| Archmage  | Will attempt to teleport within a 5-7 block distance of the player every 15 seconds while maintaining line of sight. The teleport timer ticks faster if the Archmage cannot see its target or if it's more than 12 blocks away. It will also advance by 1.5 seconds every time it takes damage. If a teleport fails, it will teleport above the player and break nearby blocks.<br/> This boss has 4 attacks:<br/> - Cross Lightning: telegraph a lightning spawn at the target location, then striking in the cardinal and then diagonal directions. AOE increases below half health.<br/> - Eruption: fires two volleys of high-damage magma that ignore blocks up and outward in all directions. First volley goes further out, second covers the interior of the previous volley. Lower delay between volleys below half health.<br/> - Fangs: fires a spread of 5 lines of Evoker fangs that ignore invincibility. Increases to 7 below half health.<br/> - Icicles: fires a rapid spread of ice projectiles directly above the player's location during the start of the attack, and the Archmage itself will fire a volley of 4 directly at the target. Increases to 6 below half health. |
| Bot       | If the target is 3-7 blocks away, will occasionally perform a short dash towards the target. If the target is more than 8 blocks away, will throw an ender pearl directly at the target. If the Bot is hurt or cannot see the target, ticks a panic timer; when this panic timer reaches 0, it will summon a pearl directly at the target which will materialize after a short delay.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Gunner    | Will attempt to move within 7 blocks of the player. Has 6 ranged attacks (each with varying telegraphs), but will also do melee damage: <br/> - Auto: rapidly fires bullets forward while slowly turning towards the target.<br/> - Burst: fires a burst of 3 predictive high-damage bullets.<br/> - Shotgun: only if within 7 blocks, fires two high damage and slightly predictive volleys of shots.<br/> - Snipe: only if outside 13 blocks, telegraphs a shot in a straight line, and fires a second later, traveling instantly. This is decreased to 0.4s below half health.<br/> - Rocket: fires two slow-moving extremely damaging firework rockets at the player position. These will always explode once reaching the target position.<br/> - Trident: this attack is only used when enraged (when target leaves line of sight for 20 total seconds) or when the Gunner is completely submerged. Throws a rapid stream of highly destructive explosive tridents.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
